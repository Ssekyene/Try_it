# CRYPTOGRAPHY-DEMO
This folder contains two c source code programs ie;
File_crypt: this gets text from the console, encrypts it and redirects the ciphertext to a file.
File_decrypt: this reads gibberish text from the ciphertext file, decrypts it and redirects the intelligible message to plaintext file.
